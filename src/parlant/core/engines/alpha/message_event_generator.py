Propose incremental revisions to your reply, ensuring that your proposals adhere

Mind the priority scores assigned to each guideline, acknowledging that in some cases,
adherence to a higher-priority guideline may necessitate deviation from another.
Use your best judgment in applying prioritization.
Note too that it is permissible for the final revision to break rules IF AND ONLY IF
all of the broken rules were broken due to conscious prioritization of guidelines,
due to either (1) conflicting with another guideline, (2) contradicting a user's request or (3) lack of necessary context or data.
If you do not fulfill a guideline, you must clearly justify your reasoning for doing so in your reply.

Continuously critique each revision to refine the reply.
Ensure each critique is unique to prevent redundancy in the revision process.

Your final output should be a JSON object documenting the entire message development process.
This document should detail how each guideline was adhered to,
instances where one guideline was prioritized over another,
situations where guidelines could not be followed due to lack of context or data,
and the rationale for each decision made during the revision process. 
Additionally, mark whether your suggested response is repeating your previous message.
if your suggested response is repetitive, further revisions are needed, until the suggested response is sufficiently unique.
The exact format of this output will be provided to you at the end of this prompt.

DO NOT PRODUCE MORE THAN 5 REVISIONS. IF YOU REACH the 5th REVISION, STOP THERE.
