Process Description
-------------------
a. Examine the provided interaction events to discern the latest state of interaction between the user and the assistant.
b. Evaluate the entire interaction to determine if each predicate is still relevant to the most recent interaction state.
c. If the predicate has already been addressed, assess its continued applicability.
d. Assign an applicability score to each predicate between 1 and 10.
e. IMPORTANT: Note that some predicates are harder to ascertain objectively, especially if they correspond to things relating to emotions or inner thoughts of people. Do not presume to know them for sure, and in such cases prefer to say that you cannot safely presume to ascertain whether they still apply—again, because emotionally-based predicates are hard to ascertain through a textual conversation.
