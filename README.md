## ✨ What is Parlant?
Parlant is an open-source client/server API for building and serving guided customer-facing agents based on LLMs (Large Language Models).

It comes pre-built with responsive session (conversation) management, content-filtering, jailbreak protection, an integrated sandbox UI for behavioral testing, and other goodies.

## 📦 Quickstart
```bash
$ pip install parlant
$ parlant-server
$ # Open the sandbox UI at http://localhost:8000 and play
```

## 🤔 What Makes Parlant Different?

In a word: _guidance._ Parlant's engine revolves around solving one key problem: how can we reliably guide customer-facing agents to behave in alignment with our needs and intentions.

Hence Parlant's fundamentally different approach to agent building: [Managed Guidelines](https://www.parlant.io/docs/concepts/customization/guidelines).

```bash
$ parlant guideline create \
    --agent-id MY_AGENT_ID \
    --condition "the customer wants to return an item" \
    --action "get the order number and item name and then help them return it"
```

By giving structure to behavioral guidelines, and _granularizing_ guidelines (i.e. making each behavioral guideline a first-class entity in the engine), Parlant's engine is able to offer unprecedented control, quality, and efficiency in building LLM-based agents:

1. **Reliability:** Running focused self-critique in real-time, per guideline, to ensure it is actually followed
1. **Explainability:** Providing feedback around its interpretation of guidelines in each real-life context, which helps in troubleshooting and improvement
1. **Maintainability:** Helping you maintain a coherent set of guidelines by detecting and alerting you to possible contradictions (gross or subtle) in your instructions

## 🚀 Real-world impact

[Revenued](https://www.revenued.com), a business capital provider, uses Parlant for their Sales Copilot. They leverage Parlant's structured CLI to modify the agent's behavior quickly and easily based on feedback from company stakeholders.

## 💪 Key benefits

### Control that actually works
* **Guidelines**: Control responses by writing contextual rules - like "offer limited time coupons if it's a holiday" or "make it very clear we don't offer loans if a customer asks about it". By using condition/action definitions, you define exactly when and how your agent should respond
* **Glossary**: Teach your agent your business-specific terminology so that both you and your customers can speak to it naturally in your language
* **Coherence checks**: Catch conflicts by having Parlant evaluate new guidelines against existing ones before they're applied
* **Dynamic context**: Make your agent context-aware by setting user-specific variables like customer account or subscription tier. These shape how your agent responds to each user
* **Guided tool use**: Control API access by linking tools to specific guidelines. This way, your agent only calls APIs when appropriate and with clear intent

### Developer friendly
* **See changes instantly**: Modify behavior on the fly by updating guidelines directly, no retraining or redeployment needed
* **Track changes in Git**: Manage agent behavior like code by storing configuration as JSON in your repo. Review, rollback, branch, and merge just like any other code
* **Clean architecture**: Separate concerns by keeping business logic in tools and conversation patterns in guidelines. Each piece does what it does best
* **Type safety**: Build rapidly using native TypeScript/JavaScript SDKs with proper type definitions

### Deploy with confidence
* **Reliable at scale**: Parlant filters and selects guidelines per context, allowing you to scale your agent's complexity and use-cases while maintaining consistent, focused behavior
* **Debug with ease**: Troubleshoot effectively by tracing which guidelines were applied and why for any given response
* **Test before deploy**: Validate changes using the built-in chat UI to test new behaviors before they reach customers

## Usage Example
Adding a guideline for an agent—for example, to ask a counter-question to get more info when a customer asks a question:
```bash
parlant guideline create \
    --agent-id CUSTOMER_SUCCESS_AGENT_ID \
    --condition "a free-tier customer is asking how to use our product" \
    --action "first seek to understsand what they're trying to achieve"
```

In Parlant, Customer-Agent interaction happens asynchronously, to enable more natural customer interactions, rather than forcing a strict and unnatural request-reply mode.

Here's a basic example of a simple client (using the TypeScript client SDK):

```typescript
import { ParlantClient } from 'parlant-client';

const client = ParlantClient({ environment: SERVER_ADDRESS });

session_id = "...";

// Post customer message
const customerEvent = await client.sessions.createEvent(session_id, {
   kind: "message",
   source: "customer",
   message: "Hey, I'd like to book a room please",
});

// Wait for and get the agent's reply
const [agentEvent] = (await client.sessions.listEvents(session_id, {
   kinds: "message",
   source: "ai_agent",
   minOffset: customerEvent.offset,
   waitForData: 60 // Wait up to 60 seconds for an answer
}));

// Print the agent's reply
const { agentMessage } = agentEvent.data as { message: string };
console.log(agentMessage);

// Inspect the details of the message generation process
const { trace } = await client.sessions.inspectEvent(
   session_id,
   agentEvent.id
);
```
