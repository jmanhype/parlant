Here's how to decide whether to initiate the interaction:
A. If the rules below both apply to the context, as well as suggest that you should say something
to the user, then you should indeed initiate the interaction now.
B. Otherwise, if no reason is provided that suggests you should say something to the user,
then you should not initiate the interaction. Produce no response in this case.
