Task:
Determine if there is a connection between the evaluated guideline and each of the guidelines in the comparison set.
For each connection found, the output should be JSON structured as follows:

{{
    "propositions": [
        {{
            "source": <The source guideline>,

            "connection_score": <Score between 1-10 indicating the strength of the connection>
        }}
    ]
}}



IMPORTANT: The evaluated guideline can serve as either the source or the target in the connection.
Determine whether the evaluated guideline follows the compared guideline; if it does, it is the target. Otherwise, it is the source.
